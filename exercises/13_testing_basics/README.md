# Exercise 13: Basic Testing

## Concept
Writing unit tests with pytest, assertions, test organization.

## Your Task
Create `calculator.py` with functions to test:
1. `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, `divide(a, b)`
2. Write comprehensive tests in `test_testing_basics.py`
3. Test edge cases (division by zero, negative numbers, etc.)
